`np.random.seed(19680801)` sets NumPy's random number generator to a specific starting point using the seed value 19680801,
ensuring reproducible pseudo-random results. The date 1968-08-01 likely references Matplotlib's "birthday," making this a
common seed in examples from its gallery or docs.

## Line Breakdown

`np.random.seed(19680801)` initializes the seed before generating random numbers, so every run produces identical sequences
(e.g., `np.random.rand(3)` always yields the same array). [scaler](https://www.scaler.com/topics/numpy-random-seed/)

`np = numpy` assigns the imported NumPy module (typically `import numpy as np`) to a shorter variable, a shorthand convention
for cleaner code—though redundant if `np` is already defined.

## Reproducibility Example

```python
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(19680801)
print(np.random.rand(3))  # Always: [0.36526112 0.60051635 0.92549417] or similar fixed values
```

Without the seed, outputs vary each run.

`np.random.randn` generates random numbers from the standard normal (Gaussian) distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.
Called without arguments, it returns a single float; with shape parameters like `np.random.randn(3,4)`, it creates a NumPy
array of that shape filled with such samples.

## Usage Examples

- Scalar: `np.random.randn()` → one random float (e.g., -0.23).
- 1D array: `np.random.randn(5)` → array of 5 values.
- 2D array: `np.random.randn(2,3)` → 2x3 matrix.

## Key Properties

Unlike `rand` (uniform ), `randn` follows the bell curve: most values cluster near 0, with tails extending
positively/negatively. With a prior seed like `19680801`, results stay reproducible across runs.

A seed in random number generation is a starting value that initializes the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) algorithm.
It ensures that the same sequence of "random" numbers is produced every time you run the code with that seed, making results
reproducible for testing, debugging, or experiments. [pythontutorials](https://www.pythontutorials.net/blog/numpyrandomseed/)

## How It Works

Computers can't generate true randomness, so PRNGs use a deterministic algorithm starting from the seed (e.g., an integer
like 19680801). The same seed always yields the identical sequence—e.g., `np.random.seed(42); np.random.randn(3)` outputs the
same array across runs. [sparkbyexamples](https://sparkbyexamples.com/python/numpy-random-seed-in-python/)

Without a seed (or `None`), it defaults to system entropy like current time, producing varying results each execution.

## Context in Prior Code

From earlier lines like `np.random.seed(19680801)` followed by `np.random.randn`, it fixes the generator state so random
samples (standard normal floats) match Matplotlib demos exactly.
