**Curdoc in Bokeh** is a function from the Bokeh Python library that returns the current Document object, which serves as the
central container for all models, plots, widgets, and layouts in a Bokeh server application.

## Core Purpose

The Document acts as the smallest unit of serialization in Bokeh, holding interconnected models like plots, glyphs, axes, and
UI elements such as sliders or buttons. Curdoc() provides access to this session-specific Document, enabling developers to
add roots (e.g., via `curdoc().add_root()`), manage callbacks for interactivity, and ensure synchronization between Python
server-side objects and JavaScript client-side rendering in the browser.

## Key Uses

- **Adding Elements**: Attach layouts or widgets to the Document for display, such as `curdoc().add_root(row(plot, slider))`.

- **Interactivity and Callbacks**: Register event handlers or periodic callbacks (e.g., `curdoc().add_periodic_callback()`)
  for real-time updates like streaming data.

- **Session Management**: Each user session gets a unique Document via curdoc(), supporting multi-user server apps with
  automatic two-way sync. [docs.bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/3.6.1/docs/user_guide/server/app.html)

This setup powers dynamic, live-updating visualizations in web browsers without manual JSON handling.
