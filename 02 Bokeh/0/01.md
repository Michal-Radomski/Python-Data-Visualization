**Bokeh is a Python library for creating interactive, web-ready visualizations.** It enables the creation of plots like
scatter, line, and bar charts that users can zoom, pan, and hover over directly in web browsers. Unlike static plotting
tools, Bokeh outputs HTML and JavaScript for high-performance interactivity.[2]

## Ubuntu Installation

Install Bokeh on Ubuntu using pip after ensuring Python 3 and pip are available. Run `sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip`
followed by `pip3 install bokeh` to download the library and its dependencies. Verify the installation with `bokeh --version`
or by importing in Python: `from bokeh.plotting import figure, show`.[4][2]

## Basic Usage Example

Start with a simple script to generate a plot. Create a figure with `figure()`, add glyphs like circles via `p.circle()`,
then display using `show(p)`. For server apps, use `bokeh serve your_script.py` to host interactive dashboards.[7][2]

## JavaScript/TypeScript Equivalent

BokehJS serves as Bokeh's direct equivalent in JavaScript/TypeScript, powering the client-side rendering of Python-generated
plots. Written primarily in TypeScript, it handles model deserialization from JSON and browser-based interactivity, allowing
standalone use in JS/TS projects via npm packages or CDN.[1][5][7]
