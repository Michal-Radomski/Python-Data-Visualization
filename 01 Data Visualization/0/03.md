**sklearn.datasets Overview** The `sklearn.datasets` module in scikit-learn provides a variety of toy datasets for machine
learning tasks, including classification, regression, and clustering examples. These datasets are built-in and accessible via
loader functions like `load_iris()` or generators like `make_classification()`. They serve as standard benchmarks for testing
algorithms.[3]

**Toy Loaders** Common loader functions return pre-loaded datasets:

- `load_iris()`: 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features for classification.[5][3]
- `load_wine()`: 178 wine samples with 13 chemical features for multi-class classification.[1][3]
- `load_diabetes()`: 442 diabetes patient records with 10 physiological features for regression.[1][5]
- `load_digits()`: 1,797 8x8 pixel handwritten digit images for classification.[5][1]
- `load_linnerud()`: 20 exercise records with 3 exercise and 3 physiological variables for multi-output regression.[3][1]
- `load_breast_cancer()`: 569 tumor samples with 30 features for binary classification.[3]

**Fetchers and Generators** Additional functions download or generate data on demand:

- `fetch_california_housing()`: 20,640 housing block groups for median house value regression.[1][3]
- `make_classification()`, `make_regression()`, `make_blobs()`: Synthetic data generators for custom classification,
  regression, or clustering tasks.[3]
- Others include `fetch_covtype()`, `fetch_kddcup99()`, `fetch_rcv1()`, and `fetch_openml()` for larger datasets.[7][3]

For the complete authoritative list, refer to the official scikit-learn documentation, as versions may add or update
loaders.[9][3]
