A histogram of an image shows how many pixels are dark, midtone, and bright, plotted as a graph. Understanding it helps you
judge exposure, contrast, and whether details are being lost in shadows or highlights.[2][3]

## What data a histogram shows

- A histogram is a graph of **pixel** brightness values in your image. The horizontal axis shows tone from black (left)
  through midtones (center) to white (right).[3][7]
- The vertical axis shows how many pixels have each brightness value; taller spikes mean more pixels at that tone, shorter
  spikes mean fewer.[9][2]
- Some cameras and editors show a luminance histogram (overall brightness) and separate RGB histograms, which plot the
  distribution for red, green, and blue channels.[7]

## How to read the shape

- If most of the graph is bunched to the left, the image is likely very dark or underexposed, with many shadow pixels and
  risk of blocked-up blacks.[8][3]
- If most of the graph is pushed to the right, the image is likely very bright or overexposed, with many highlight pixels and
  risk of blown-out whites.[3][8]
- A broadly spread, more centered histogram often indicates a well-exposed scene with a good range of tones, though the
  “right” shape still depends on the subject (e.g., night scenes will naturally be left-heavy).[2][3]

## Clipping and dynamic range

- When the graph is piled up hard against the left edge, it means clipping in shadows: detail in the darkest areas has been
  lost to pure black.[10][3]
- When the graph is piled up hard against the right edge, it means clipping in highlights: bright areas have lost detail and
  turned pure white.[10][3]
- Scenes with very high dynamic range tend to show the graph stretched toward both ends, sometimes touching one or both
  edges, indicating that the scene brightness exceeds what the sensor can record without clipping.[8][2]

## Practical usage when shooting

- Use the histogram instead of just the LCD preview to decide if you need to brighten or darken exposure (via shutter speed,
  aperture, or ISO). If the graph leans too far left, increase exposure; if too far right, decrease it.[5][8]
- Aim for a distribution that suits your subject: low-key images will lean left, high-key images will lean right, but in both
  cases try to avoid heavy clipping unless it is intentional.[3][10]
- If your camera shows RGB histograms, watch for clipping in individual color channels (e.g., only the red channel hitting
  the right edge), which can cause color shifts and loss of detail in that channel.[7]

## Practical usage in editing

- In editing software, moving exposure/brightness, blacks, shadows, highlights, and whites sliders will change the histogram
  shape as tones are shifted left or right.[4][2]
- Use the histogram while editing to:
  - Bring detail back into shadows and highlights where possible.
  - Adjust contrast so tones are more spread out without crushing blacks or blowing highlights.[2][3]
- If the histogram shows “gaps” or steps instead of smooth variation after heavy editing, it can signal posterization
  (banding), meaning tonal data has been degraded.[2]

If you share a specific photo or describe it (very dark, very bright, high contrast, etc.), a tailored explanation can walk
through how its histogram would look and what adjustments to make.
